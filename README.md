# Progressbar with Framer Motion
This repository contains the code for my Progressbar with Framer Motion video tutorial. Please note that this code is not tested and may contain errors and therefore should not be used in a real app.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
